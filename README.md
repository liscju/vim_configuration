Installation:
In general it doesnt need special treatment, you only need
to install pathogen according to appropriate instruction, then
copy bundle dir to ~/.vim/bundle and .vimrc to ~/.vimrc. Apart
from this you need exuberant-tags for tags to work correctly, 
and there is a chance that you need to recompile YouCompleteMe
or download and set it once again. Dont forget about .ycm_extra_conf.py
it must be included in your home dir and in project if there are
special compiler flag for them
